3. The URLs for the chrome and IE driver needs to be changed inside @BeforeMethod annotation.
4. Data (Google search keywords) is provided as part of the @DataProvider annotation.
5. An outer loop is created to capture the number of pages to search through.
6. The inner loop captures the search results and prints the text of the URLs.
7. Whenever search result matches the parameter ("finzy"), we get out of the outer loop.
8. Whenever search result matches keyword, it also prints which page it's found.
9. Parallel execution can be performed by providing the parallel parameter for the suite in the TestNG.xml.
